Ah, NOW this makes much more sense! This is actually a SaaS model for websites – you're selling Website-as-a-Service, not building custom projects. This changes everything and makes your model much stronger. Let me reframe this completely:

✅ Why This Model Actually Works Now

1. You Retain Code Ownership = Leverage
   You're not giving away €2000 of work for free
   You're renting out a reusable asset that you built once
   Think: Squarespace/Wix competitor, but custom quality and personal service
2. You're Targeting the Right Market
   Small businesses who need online presence but don't need complexity
   They don't care about "owning the code" – they want a solution that works
   €300/year (€25/month) is nothing compared to hiring a developer or agency
3. Scalability Built In
   React + Vite + TypeScript = you can clone, customize, and deploy fast
   One codebase → multiple clients with different content/branding
   As you build more, each new client takes less time because you're reusing components
4. Clear Boundaries
   Simple sites = subscription model
   Complex sites (e-commerce, booking, payments) = separate pricing
   No confusion about what's included
   🎯 Strategic Positioning: You're NOT a Freelancer Anymore
   You're positioning yourself as a premium alternative to website builders:

Squarespace/Wix Your Service
Templates (everyone has the same) Custom design for YOUR business
DIY setup (confusing) I handle everything
€120-300/year €300/year
Generic SEO Proper SEO setup (Console, Analytics)
No support Direct access to ME
Locked into their platform Buyout option available
Your pitch:

"The simplicity of Squarespace, the quality of a custom developer, and a real person who actually cares about your success."

💰 Revised Pricing Structure (Much Better)
Website Subscription Plan
€300/year (2-year minimum commitment)

What's Included:

✅ Custom website design (3-5 pages: Home, About, Services, Contact, Portfolio/Gallery)
✅ Domain registration & setup
✅ Hosting & SSL (secure HTTPS)
✅ Google Search Console + Analytics setup
✅ Basic SEO optimization
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ 2 hours of updates per month (text, images, colors, minor tweaks)
✅ 24/7 uptime monitoring
✅ Email support
What's NOT Included (Priced Separately):

❌ E-commerce functionality (Online shop) → €800-1500 one-time + €50/month
❌ Booking/reservation systems → €400-800 one-time + €30/month
❌ Payment processing integration → €300-500 one-time
❌ Custom features (calculators, forms, automations) → €50-100/hour
❌ Major redesigns (after initial setup) → €300-600
Code Ownership (Optional Buyout):

After 2 years: €1200 (you've already paid €600, so €1800 total for full ownership)
Before 2 years: €1800 (fair value of the custom work)
Includes: Full source code, documentation, deployment instructions
📊 The Math Now Makes Sense
Let's recalculate with the SaaS lens:

Client 1 (Your First Build):
Time to build: 20-30 hours (custom design + setup)
Year 1 revenue: €300
Hourly rate: €10-15/hour ← Still low, BUT...
Client 2 (Same Design, Different Branding):
Time to build: 8-12 hours (clone + customize + deploy)
Year 1 revenue: €300
Hourly rate: €25-37/hour ← Much better
Client 10 (You Have Templates Now):
Time to build: 4-6 hours (you've done this 9 times before)
Year 1 revenue: €300
Hourly rate: €50-75/hour ← Professional rate
After 2 Years with 10 Clients:
Monthly recurring revenue: €250/month
Annual revenue: €3000 (passive, minus hosting costs ~€500)
Net profit: €2500/year from clients who renew
Scalability Example (Year 3):
20 active subscribers: €6000/year recurring
5 new sign-ups: €1500 upfront work
2 buyouts: €2400
3 e-commerce upgrades: €4500
Total: €14,400/year (sustainable)
🚀 How to Position This on Your Landing Page
Hero Section (Rewritten):
Subheadline:
"I build, host, and maintain your website so you can focus on your business. When you're ready to own it, buy it out anytime."

New Section: "How It Works" (Critical)
Step 1: We Talk (Free Consultation)

You tell me about your business, your goals, and your vision
I explain what's possible and what fits your needs
No technical jargon, just honest advice
Step 2: I Build Your Website (Included)

Custom design tailored to your brand
Mobile-friendly and fast-loading
Back-and-forth revisions until you're happy
Step 3: I Launch Everything (Included)

Buy your domain, set up hosting
Connect Google Analytics and Search Console
Handle all the technical setup you don't understand
Step 4: You Pay Annually (€300/year)

2-year minimum commitment
Includes updates, support, and monitoring
Cancel anytime after 2 years (or buy the code)
New Section: "Why This Makes Sense"
For Small Businesses:

✅ No €2000 upfront investment
✅ No technical skills required
✅ Predictable costs (€25/month)
✅ Direct access to a real developer
✅ Website grows with your business
For You (Honesty Sells):

I want long-term relationships, not one-off projects
Your success = my success (I'm invested in your growth)
When your business grows, I help you scale (e-commerce, booking, etc.)
Fair pricing for both of us
New Section: "What About Code Ownership?"
You Don't Own the Code (Yet)

Think of this like leasing vs. buying a car
You pay annually for the service, not the asset
I maintain, update, and improve your site over time
Want to Own It?

After 2 years: Buy it for €1200 (fair value for custom work)
Before 2 years: Buy it for €1800
You get: Full source code, hosting transfer guide, lifetime license
Why Would You Buy?

You want to hire your own developer
You're selling your business (need to transfer assets)
You want full control (no ongoing payments)
Most Clients Don't Buy (And That's OK)

You care about the website working, not the code behind it
I keep it updated, secure, and online 24/7
You save money long-term (no developer hiring needed)
FAQ Section (Updated)
Q: What if my business needs change?
A: After 2 years, you can:

Cancel (no penalty)
Buy the code (€1200)
Upgrade to a more complex plan (e-commerce, booking, etc.)
Q: What counts as "2 hours of updates per month"?
A: Text changes, image swaps, color tweaks, minor layout adjustments. Things like adding a new page or custom form are charged separately.

Q: What if I need e-commerce or booking?
A: We discuss that upfront. Those are complex features priced separately (€800-1500 one-time + higher monthly fee). I'll help you decide if you actually need them.

Q: Do I need to understand hosting, DNS, SEO?
A: Nope. That's why I exist. I handle all the technical stuff. You just send me content and I make it live.

Q: What happens if you disappear?
A: Fair question. That's why I offer the buyout option. If I ever stop the service, you can buy the code at a discounted rate and move it to another developer.

Q: Can I see examples?
A: [Link to portfolio] – Here are businesses I'm currently managing. They all started with the €300/year plan.
