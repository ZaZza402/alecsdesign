      },

        "question": "Can I switch models later?",

      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What happens after the 2-year subscription commitment?",

        "question": "Do I need to understand hosting, DNS, SEO, or technical stuff?",

      "q6": {
        "question": "What counts as 'content changes' in management plans?",

      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Why not just use Wix or Squarespace?",
        "answer": "Website builders are great for DIY, but you're trading simplicity for limitations. With me, you get custom code that does exactly what you need, direct support from the person who built it, and no platform lock-in. Plus, over 3 years, Wix costs €600+ (€16/month × 36) vs. €1,554 for Subscribe & Relax (€150 setup + €468/year × 3) — with better quality and personal support."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What happens if you disappear or stop the service?",
        "answer": "Fair question. If I ever stop the service, Subscribe & Relax clients can buy the code at a heavily discounted rate. Buy & Own clients already own everything. Your content and domain are always yours — you can export and move anytime."
      },
      "q9": {
        "question": "Can I cancel Subscribe & Relax before 2 years?",
        "answer": "Yes, but there's an early termination fee: either pay the remaining months or buy the code for €750 (vs. €500 after 2 years). The 2-year commitment ensures fairness — I invest time building your site upfront."
      },
      "q10": {
        "question": "How do add-ons work with each model?",
        "answer": "Add-ons (e-commerce, booking, multilingual) have different pricing for each model. Buy & Own = higher upfront, lower/no annual cost. Subscribe & Relax = lower upfront, included in annual fee. Check the pricing section above for specific rates."
