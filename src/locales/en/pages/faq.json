    {
      "question": "Are you an agency or a freelancer?",
      "answer": "I am a <strong>specialized freelance developer</strong>. When you work with me, you communicate directly with the person writing your code, not a project manager. This means faster feedback loops, lower costs (no agency overhead), and a personal commitment to your project''s success. I handle the full stack: from the visual interface to the database logic.",

      "question": "What is the difference between a Website and a Web App?",
      "answer": "Think of a <strong>website</strong> as a digital brochureit gives information (like a restaurant menu). A <strong>web app</strong> is a toolit <em>does</em> things (like a Tax Calculator, a Booking System, or a Dashboard). I specialize in building high-performance Web Apps using <strong>React and Next.js</strong>, which feel like mobile apps but run in your browser.",

    {
      "question": "How much does a project cost?",
      "answer": "Since I am a freelancer, my rates are typically <strong>30-40% lower than agencies</strong> for the same quality of code. A standard informational site starts around <strong>800</strong>. Custom Web Apps (like calculators, dashboards, or SaaS tools) typically range from <strong>2,000 to 5,000</strong> depending on the logic required. I provide a fixed-price quote upfront so there are no surprises.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to build?",
      "answer": "Because I don''t have corporate red tape, I move fast. A standard project takes <strong>2-4 weeks</strong>. Complex applications (like the ISEE Simulator) may take <strong>4-8 weeks</strong> to ensure the math and logic are perfect. I will give you a realistic timeline during our first call and update you weekly.",

    {
      "question": "What technology do you use?",
      "answer": "I don''t use outdated WordPress templates. I build with the modern stack used by top tech companies: <strong>React & Next.js</strong> for the interface, <strong>TypeScript</strong> for bug-free logic, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> for pixel-perfect design. This ensures your site is incredibly fast, secure, and ready for the future.",

    {
      "question": "Can you modernize my old website?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. I specialize in taking old, slow websites and rebuilding them into modern Web Apps. For example, if you have a PDF form on your site that clients have to print and sign, I can turn that into a digital <strong>Interactive Wizard</strong> that calculates results instantly and generates a PDF automatically.",

      "question": "Do you offer maintenance after launch?",
      "answer": "Yes, but I don''t lock you into expensive contracts. I offer a <strong>30-day warranty</strong> where I fix any bugs for free. After that, you can hire me on an hourly basis for updates, or pay a small monthly retainer (50-100) if you want me to handle hosting updates and technical health checks regularly.",

    {
      "question": "Will I own the code?",
      "answer": "<strong>100% Yes.</strong> Unlike website builders (Wix, Squarespace) where you rent your site, here you own the asset. I deliver the source code via GitHub. You are free to host it anywhere, modify it, or take it to another developer in the future. No vendor lock-in.",

    {
      "question": "How does payment work?",
      "answer": "I split payments to keep it fair for both of us: <strong>50% upfront</strong> to book my time and start development, and the remaining <strong>50% upon completion</strong> when you are happy with the result and ready to launch. I accept Bank Transfer, PayPal, or Stripe.",

      "question": "Can you handle SEO and Hosting?",
      "answer": "Yes. I build sites with <strong>Technical SEO</strong> in mind (using Next.js Server Side Rendering) so Google can read them easily. I also handle the deployment to platforms like <strong>Vercel</strong>, connect your domain, and set up your SSL (HTTPS) certificate so your site is secure from day one.",

      "answer": "Just your idea and your goals! If you have text and images, that''s great. If not, I can help you structure the content. If you have a specific design in mind, I can build it. If you don''t, I can design a clean, modern interface for you.",
