      "question": "What's the difference between a website and a web app?",
      "answer": "A <strong>website</strong> is primarily informational - it displays content like text, images, and videos (think blogs, portfolios). A <strong>web app</strong> is interactive and functional - it processes data, responds to user input, and performs tasks (think Gmail, Trello, online banking). Web apps use modern frameworks like React for dynamic functionality, offline capabilities, and app-like experiences. In 2025, most businesses benefit from web apps rather than static websites.",
