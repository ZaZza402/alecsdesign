I sit right in that sweet spot between a creative designer and a <strong>technical engineer</strong>.\n\nMy philosophy is simple: I handle the <strong>complex technology</strong> so you can focus on running your business. I don’t run a massive agency with account managers or hidden fees; I keep my operation small and focused. This means when we work together, you get <strong>direct access</strong> to the person actually building your product.\n\nI build using modern standards like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>. In plain English? That means your website isn't just a static picture; it’s a <strong>stable, scalable</strong> application that loads instantly and doesn't break under pressure. I use tools like <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>Framer Motion</strong> to ensure the design is bespoke and feels premium, without the bloat of heavy templates.\n\nI’m not chasing the biggest corporate contracts. I’m looking for partners who value clear communication, honest work, and a website that is <strong>built to last</strong>.",
