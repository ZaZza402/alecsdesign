      "question": "How is the project investment calculated?",
      "answer": "Because I build custom solutions rather than using rigid templates, the investment depends on your specific goals, the complexity of the design, and the functionality required. After a brief discovery call, I provide a detailed proposal with a transparent scope and fixed price."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Which model is right for me: Ownership or Managed?",
      "answer": "Choose 'Project Ownership' if you have an internal team or want full control of your assets immediately. Choose 'Managed Partner' if you prefer a 'digital department' experience where I handle all technical aspects, hosting, and updates for a monthly retainer."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "If I choose 'Project Ownership', do you still help me after launch?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. While you own the code, you shouldn't have to worry about server updates or security patches. I offer optional 'Care Plans' to keep your site secure, fast, and updated, so you don't have to touch the technical side."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I switch from 'Managed Partner' to full ownership later?",
      "answer": "Yes. The Managed Partner model requires a 2-year minimum commitment to cover the initial build value. After that period, you can choose to buy out the code for a fixed fee and take full ownership of the intellectual property."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Do I need to provide the server or hosting?",
      "answer": "For the 'Managed Partner' model, I provide premium cloud hosting included in the service. For 'Project Ownership', I can set up the hosting on your preferred provider or recommend a high-performance solution that fits your traffic needs."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What counts as 'content updates' in the maintenance plans?",
      "answer": "Standard updates include text changes, image swaps, blog postings, and minor layout tweaks. Major structural changes—like adding a new e-commerce section or a complex calculator—are considered 'new features' and will be quoted as a separate sprint."
